# Middleman-Blog Project Template: with Frameless adaptive grid
------

##Basics
Just your basic blank slate of a [Middleman-blog](http://middlemanapp.com/blogging/) project template, including grid SASS from [Frameless](http://framelessgrid.com/).

[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) is a static site generator based on Sinatra. Providing dozens of templating languages (Haml, Sass, Compass, Slim, CoffeeScript, and more). Makes minification, compression, cache busting, Yaml data (and more) an easy part of your development cycle.

[Frameless](http://framelessgrid.com/) is an idea for a specific type of adaptive grid. You can use it as a good starting point for a new design, but youâ€™ll still have to do all the hard work of designing and coding yourself.
* Make a regular fixed-width grid
* Make it repeat infinitely
* Center it in the viewport
* Profit

## Usage

Download and install into ~/.middleman (you'll have to create this directory if it's not already there). You can then use it with the `--template` flag on `middleman init`. For example: `middleman init your-project --template=middleman-blog-frameless`
